# ECommerce
This Java application performs three types of operations
1. add (product), where product is a string denoting a product name. This must store product as a new product in the application.
2. find (partial), where partial is a string denoting a partial name of product to search the cart for. It must count the number of products starting with partial and print the count
on a new line.
3. list (items), which prints all the products in the cart.
